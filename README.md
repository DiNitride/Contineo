# Contineo

An unfinished project to create a universal game server management tool in Go, a language which I had never worked with before, because why do something in a language you know when you can spend 4 times as long doing it something new.
Scrapped because I didn't have the time around university and then https://cubecoders.com/AMP was released anyway.
